# Fast Calendar Manager

*Dont use this on a website, it is not secure! It is only for personal use via localhost!*

This is a web app based tool for modifying my GCal faster, for blazingly fast week planning xD. I got fed up with the slowness of the Google Calendar web interface, and wanted to make it faster, so I made this.

## Features

- Add, edit, duplicate and delete events from your calendar
- Templates for events
- Background events
- Keyboard shortcuts

## How to use

1. Set up your Google Calendar API key in `public/env.json`:
```json
{
	"CLIENT_ID": "",
	"API_KEY": ""
}
```
2. Run `npm install` and `npm rund dev`
3. Modify the code however you want ðŸ˜‰
